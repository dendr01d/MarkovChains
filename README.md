# MarkovChains
A naive foray into natural language processing

I've had this idea kicking around in the back of my head for almost a year now, after I read about a primitive form of the algorithm someplace that I can't remember.

I needed to get some good code up here to show off to anyone that bothers to look at my resume, and also to learn how to use github. This is the result.

If you're reading this because you're considering hiring me, hopefully this helps to convince you that I at least have an idea of what I'm doing! Otherwise have fun generating nonsensical text.
