TO DO:
-separate everything into nice classes
    edges, nodes, graphs, dictionaries?...
-create an explicit file I/O
-add commandline arguments?
-create a file-writing system to save processed graphs
-phase out "#BREAK"s in lieu of tokens with special IDs
-come up with a way of dealing with nesting punctuation
-figure out if there's a better way to store text than the token/dictionary system
-modify nodes such that their names can be comprised of sequences of strings
