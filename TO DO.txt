TO DO:
-consider benefits of making dictionary its own class
-create an explicit file I/O
-add commandline arguments?
-create a file-writing system to save processed graphs
-phase out "#BREAK"s in lieu of tokens with special IDs
    will probably have to rewrite how edges work for this
-come up with a way of dealing with nesting punctuation
-figure out if there's a better way to store text than the token/dictionary system
-modify nodes such that their names can be comprised of sequences of strings
    maybe use concatenated strings for this? Might be easier logisticall ww passing things around
-implement a proper debug mode
