I think just sticking to the zodiac animals is going to be harder than you think
yeah of course I can't do that for all of them
also the only crabby thing about an amikiri is its arms
birdhead plus snakebody
hmmm true
and the heikegani really only works if its an actual crab
otherwise you're gonna end up with a dude with a head on his back
and that's completely different
a humanoid man crab
double the man
50% man, 50% crab, 50% more man
at this rate you might as well just pull something from heike monogatari
I imagine there's something relating to all the military themes

'u' This Is Fine
oh shit, rolls and dodges got nerfed
...by one frame
i searched bara titty on google and most of the results are jojo
I want one of those anime tiddy mousepads but with bara
star platinum's ass
so why didn't they just form sardonyx the first time they needed to tear down the hub
she seemed to dismantle it just as easily as sugilite did

so apparently someone from mane6 is local and is working on a SU brawler?
ew?
inb4 cartoon network shuts it down and they have to replace the characters with gemsonas
what part is ew? the mane6 thing?
it was honestly one of the better parts of the mlp fandom
unless they did something awful that I'm not aware of
my parents are getting a cheap shirt printed while they're in malaysia
so I gotta pick an image
Doge
Ass devourer
some more understated but memeful
I'm considering "graphic design is my passion" tbh
Oh fuck yes
Pls
In addition to the fuck ton of artifacts
Make sure nothing is centered properly
Actually ask if they can make the image on an angle or something
I need more people to submit things to my blog tbh
I could ask them to do it on a slight angle
but that might be messing with the purity of the existing meme
other candidates

Tuesday dog
tru
Double printed with shadow dog on the back
I don't think they do double prints
Only ever wear it on tuesdays
these are like, $5 shirts
which is the only reason they're demanding I get one
Then $10 lol
as opposed to, you know, ordering a custom one online for $15-ish
Um but if only 1 print
Graphic design really is pretty fucking great
Other memes are too timely
They'll get old and the joke lost
yeah, graphic design is my passion, truly a timeless piece
well-designed meme
drakengard 3 is terrible
are all the drake games like that
i feel like i was watching an LP of an anime-esque shadow the hedgehog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I don't know much about them
by which I mean anything
also it feels weird hearing tara platt swearing in her mitsuru voice
they look pretty meh though
THEY DO
DK3 LOOKS TERRIBLE
on the other hand
the good man Demo
it looks like it was made on the same engine as PSO2, but PSO2 manages to look better than it
did a review of Drakengard and outright said "the game looks worse than it is" until you finish it
looks, in the sense of enjoying
not visuals
apparently each plotline is pretty critical to understanding and enjoying it?
who'da guessed
critical enough that EVERYONE hates it after playing the game
until they've played it like 3-4 times
with different endings

if you want a shitty weaboo's take on it
yes
it has 4 endings and the story itself has a interesting concept coupled with the endings
but apparently even the developers didn't like the endings
so they had to make a novel with a 5th canon ending
oh boy lol
that does not surprise me


Face the Power of my Stand, SHIA LABEOUF
the sound of his voice causes an irresistible urge to do SOMETHING of the user's choice
once the thought is placed in their mind, and only 1 can exist at a time, the urge grows until the victim is forced to perform the action no matter what
the urge reaches its peak after 24 hours
"yesterday, you said tomorrow. so JUST DO IT"
because Shia's power still cannot overcome raw instinct
those who have high willpower or have trained themselves to do things on instinct can resist his voice for certain actions
but those who don't have the strength to resist...
well..
they get to the point where anyone else would stop
and they keep on going
that sounds like a very good stand
i like the concept 
would it be used by a villain?
possibly
I think the restriction that it only suggests actions
and grows in power over time
means it could very easily be used by a protag or something
who even explains his power to his victims
to affect their judgement
if the urge were just there without their understanding
they might ignore it
This message has been removed.
once they understand its irresistible*
and they'll have to, say, close their eyes and count to 10 some time in the next day
they might be inclined to get it out of the way now, so they don't get stuck doing it at a worse time
also, maybe simpler actions are stronger suggestions?
things that are more complex or time demanding would be less effective
and the user adapts his/her strategy to the rules
like part 7 stands
it doesn't actually fight
and can't help directly against other stands in conflict
but it can be used to talk his way out of trouble
I think the user should be a villain and a cannibal
or, if worst comes, they can suggest crippling actions on the victim
to complete the refrance
Cannibal, yes
villain? nah
I think Shia is far more upstanding than that
serial killer or not
how would you make a non-villain cannibal
lol
ok good pont

why is unreal engine so dumb
for real
even something like making a volume slider is monumentally painful
this is an engine that was cobbled together for one, specific game, and later reworked so that it's vaguely usable by others
and it shows
the only pro compared to unity is that it makes things pretty, ugh ugh ugh

I'll be down for that in like... 3 days

oh my g
every time I make a build in unreal it makes the power of the house flicker lmao
my computer consumes all (which is slightly less funny bc we pay electric)
holy shit
that's incredible
it's unbelievable
it might even be...
unreal.
does it actually do that omg
that's kind of 2spooky


the original director of the game was there too
cut content restored ? new content added?
high quality music and voices \o/
yes IZJS YEEEEEES
YT changed the looks of the video UI
i kind of like it

why is this picture so ominous to me


<<< 
put your email address on both fields to get a code for the game :o
it's a big DL according to people can take up to 3 hours of download
...
oh god yes
the demo is the same as the free pc trial of which i played
but this should help 
i used this to guide me around the japanese menus
it stops at the extended offline campaign which in the (full subbed game) pc version is like a bonus thignfor items and equipment in online


it doesn't even sound like the original

they're teasing a port of a long awaited game
enjoy the one day of m3 hype before it turns out to be something more realistic :)
shut up ;-;
dont do this to me

I've seen that post like 50 times
capn is a good
they're gonna port dark souls to the wii u
it's probably like
minecraft or something
:p
what's a long awaited port of a (nintendo) game besides M3
hey you pikachu
aradia - zashiki warashi (ghost child that brings fortune to the home it haunts)
sollux - literally just sollux in a bee suit
tavros - minotaur
nepeta - nekomata
karkat - kama itachi (sickle weasel, makes slashes that heal up instantly as a prank)
kanaya - vampire
terezi - dragon
vriska - tsuchigumo (same as yamame)
equius - kirin
gamzee - oni
eridan - kappa
feferi - koromodako (octopus that turns giant to engulf anything, then shrinks)
calliope - cherub
caliborn/LE - gashadokuro (giant fucking skeleton)
you win etoid, I went with your choice for karkat


<<< karkat - kama itachi<u<
whoa whoa wait
the "slashes that heal up instantly" makes a bit more fitting
out of all the spidery things you could have picked for Vriska
it's either that or the whore spider
I mean
I guess I could do that but it's slightly mean spirited haha
also aranea automatically becomes the other one, unless there's a good western myth to use
oh wait
Aranea could be Anansi
perhaps.
one interesting idea is that any of the alpha trolls would be limited to relatively obscure and non-Japanese myths
and I could put them into the plot as a group of outsiders or interlopers
wouldn't they be the beta trolls
or do you mean the Troll trolls
uh, I guess beta trolls
I always got confused about that
I hate typing dancestor though
that's such a dumb name for them?
pre-scratch. there.
what idiot looked at the words "ancestor" and "descendant" and thought "yeah let's just stick a d in front of ancestor that's a good portmaneau I'm SMART"
boss fight against roxy:
"fight me! I bet won't spill a single drop of this sake"

2013 news article
your point being....
nothin', just old
i linked this because i was reading it on EB central and was surprised that japanese fans reacted so negatively to M3 compared to how hyped it usually is in the states
kinda makes sense though

it me
is that the shirt you're getting printed?
it should be
what is it with u and shibas anyways
I thought sloths were your thing
I'm sorry for liking 2 things at the same time
CRUNCHUROLL WHY U STUTTER
I WANT MY HAPPY SLICE OF LIFE ANIMES
fractal it's because I'm torrenting hardcore porn 24/7
DAMMIT CK
it's not biologically possible for you to like two things at once
you either like one or the other


<<< I WANT MY HAPPY SLICE OF LIFE ANIMESyo Frac
I NEED TO WATCH MY LOVE STORY ITS THE BEST
if you are watching some slice of life anime
go watch Gakkou Gurashi
its pretty cute
NO (maybe)
yes
whats it about
ok so its a school life anime
go watch ep 1
don't spoil yourself cuz the descriptions kinda ruin some of the first episode jokes
I still want to see a story where the first half is slice-of-life and then midseason it suddeny transitions into action/adventure
I want a slice-of-life in a fantasy universe where everyone is supposed to be questing but they're too busy slice-of-living
meanwhile the world goes to shit around them
isn't that basically every fandom's "all the characters live in a house together AU"
isn't that homestuck
eugh
but no I mean like imagine nichijou but halfway through it turns into klk
most actiony animes have like half of the first episode to characterize everyone
better yet
imagine nichijou
but it would be nice to spend a sizable amount of time learning about everyone in a relatively mundane context
with humor and nonseriousness
isn't that steven universe
oh wait I'm sorry, you're the one who hates it because it's too slow
I mean all at once though
also steven universe doesn't have the right flavor, I guess?
even while silly stuff is happening the serious stuff is still hanging over their heads
and I'm talking about a clear cutoff where the story goes from lackadaisical to serious plot
Kyoukai no Kanata kinda did that?
like, kinda.
it definitely started heavy
but pretty silly
very character driven
became more actiony in the second half
like, 1 ep turn around
big kinda though
I couldn't bear to watch that one because the characters were so gross

this is better than most ytps
nnnnndif u think

true
My love story is the best slice of life
someone take that video and speed it up so that the words are back to normal
it doesn't even need the action but it has some
also its adorable and subverts a lot of tropes
CK are you actually torrenting stuff
CK are you actually torrenting porn
I could use some recs
no I'm not torrenting stuff
at most I scroll through my tumblr dash rly fast
ok then crunchyroll is just being shit
crunchyroll is always shit
go get kissanime
its never been for me
easy
don't use flash player
use the other player
and just use the browser player link under the embedded
its pretty reliable and quick for streaming
ok but crunchy roll is usually better is all
w/e, im using kissanime
etoid I pitched it up

if I speed it up, then it just sounds like normal but choppy
oh speaking of internet fractal
we can totally forward ports for INTERNET GAMES
without Hamachi shit
yes
whoa
someone have ULiL and want to test
woah the last update to ULiL changes it quite a bit
koishi got buffed
occult abilities got way buffed but leave you vulnerable to stealing... seemingly forever?
was it the same change that fixed mokou?
or another one later?
I might not have that patch yet
idk? 1.11
uh one easy way to check
koishi's jumping melee looks different
opening it now to see
now it has two roses to the side, making the hitbox very obvious
and she turns red when she dash-teleports
lol im still 1.03
ok I'll patch and play some with you guys later maybe?
or just tomorrow
some time in the future
I wanna play more ULiL I know that
what was wrong with mokou btw
her white health didn't disappear quickly enough after using her rebirth
so
if she rebirthed
then used it again immediately
she recovered the same HP again that she just got
aka, if she was at 1/2 HP
and 1/2 of that (1/4 total) was white
then when she rebirths, she normally gets set back to 1/2 real HP
but the bug let her rebirth immediately again and heal to 3/4
by getting another 1/4
then to full
that's why you make your visible health bars different from your actual health variable

its been too long

i ghostwrote that for him

Why were you playing so badly like damn
read description


better with or without green
go watch ermine in a tree on youtube btw
with
imo
or second link
whichever it is
I was thinking so too. it's almost too much color but it works out


quick make a stand based on it
the ability to retrieve any object when asked "may I take your order" at any restaurant
define object
any non-living object that is small enough to be carried on a fast food tray
when prompted, the person taking the order will unconsciously form the desired object out of any food that is available
the end result will be exactly the same as the original, but if interrupted, the original will be lost in fast food limbo
for example, you could order "the declaration of independence"
and they would start making it out of lettuce and hamburger buns and shit
the original is simultaneously replaced with the ingredients used
there would be a pile of food where the declaration of independence once was
:O
now that's a cool power
you could use this not only to retrieve something you wanted, but to remove inconvenient objects
like bombs
possible secondary ability: can use happy meal toys as weapons
any action simulated by a toy is replaced with its real life equivalent
you can tap someone with the back of your cheap plastic fluttershy, and it will be like they got kicked by an actual horse
a villain with this stand would likely have a massive collection of such toys
like the nerd guy from that one PPG episode

tbh I like the idea of a menacing jjba villain
going through the mcdonalds drive through
and ordering like 10 happy meals
he knows that you can just buy the toys but he's also really hungry
I just remembered something I wanted to point out
remember how steven threw his shield at peridot
and then way earlier he threw his kickboard at the giant pufferfish
yeah he's captain america

Esoterics weapon or chest piece for Machinist
i haven't played in a month due to summer heat affecting my computer's ability to play heavy games like FFXIV or GW2
but um both of those are equally important and heavy stat wise so
i'd go with weapon
the machinist vest looks good though
augh
a guy in my FC decided PLD sucked and wasted his esoterics on WAR armor instead of a weapon and he basically killed the static

yeah I guess ill go for Ferdinand

r/punchablefaces got shut down and taken over by le sjws, brilliant
I'm suddenly in the mood to watch some high-level soku
Elementoid goes to watch replays where I curbstomped ck
it's funny bc that hasn't happened in like 4 years
when was the last time we played soku :V
we should fite
lolno
no I need to test whether my port forward works anyways
let's play ror then
no
k
CK Crash slams fist on the table
soku
how this usually works is I think "eh maybe this'll be fun"
and then it is for like 30 seconds
the end
I guess I ought to set a timer
I can at least enjoy empirically determining my lack of enjoyment
okay so what version are we going to go with here
v1.1a with sokuroll I guess
71.47.26.35:10800
dunno if I even have that
well... do you?
lookin like... no?
it's saying I need to update to version 1.10
sokuroll also probably needs to be updated
ugh I'm gonna have to rebuild my deck
for some reason I can't install the english translation
finally, ugh
oddly enough it controls better than I remember
tell me when to start hosting again
kk
lemme just try and figure out how to make it bigger
sigh
there doesn't seem to be a way to change the window size aside from just going fullscreen
welcome to 640x480
isn't there something in SWRSToys?
I'm not gonna squint at this tiny-ass game window on my high def monitor
swrstoys works
that took like 5 seconds just do it etoid
first two links when you google SWRStoys
eh, whatevs
I'm getting sleepy so let's just get this over with
ready when you are I guess
hosting


<<< 71.47.26.35:10800
connection failed
weh
evolve or w/e then
9_9
we're both suffering here
easy for you to say


<<< I'm not gonna squint at this tiny-ass game window on my high def monitorsizer

oh evolve recognizes soku
neato

hm
10.245.225.2:10800
did you join party?
I was gonna thank u ag for actually helping me with my problems but it doesn't want to install
so you get nothing
wow evolve has ads now
connection failed
FINE you host
k
go
remember 45 minutes ago when you said


<<< we should fite
why this
did you have the window open
you launched sokuroll right
when you opened evolve
v1.10ac+r 1.3 right
if you didn't close soku, close and reopen blegh
<<<<_<<<<<
If you have a sweet tooth, give us a whirl
we'll make your whole world sweeter
thank u evolve ad
okay there I did the fucking thing AGAIN
are you connecting or what
I think you cursed it
R 1.3 right???
"etoid why do you never play video games with meee"
idek w sokuroll
let's just try without it
fineeeee
if I can figure out how to turn it off
close and reload :V
hosting
I can't even ping you through evolve
fuckin what
fucking finally
let's get this over with

fuck which deck is it
congrats you made it a whole 31 seconds
bab
thanks alice....
I don't remember like any combos
ew
me neither?????
where the fuck are my good cards
is this even the right deck
nope
brb
I only have decks for like 5 chars
ugh I meant to be using the yellow one
rly
rly
I'm finding it easier to make use of guard breaks and melee now hmmm
what happened to my precious blockstrings
...block-ing???
hope this is the right deck :U
okay this is much better
I actually remember sakuya
hrm
gonna go check my deck
this one FEELS right but idk
seems like your standard
unless you're missing a special
but you always used bouncing knives, teleport, and swords idk
I just abhor skill cards in general unless I'm upgrading my standards
okay hosting again
this deck is a bit flashier
and I've got a really experimental one
snane
time for rng
pressure like a wet noodle
ye there we go
why did they make her gimmick 8 way dash and then make it slow as balls again
can't really remember what's in this one so
??
her flight is great
u kiddin me
learn to use your bullets man
or, remember to
sanae is so fun
she doesn't get the time she needs to setup against sakuya
why does sakuya even have alt cards again
w/o a knockdown
so she can dio pose
o right
lol
HA
9 years of startup is my favorite spell card
I mean
time to play filia
it's no The World
ugh
I hate filaya
icky
lol rly
she's really a lot like parasoul
I remember your iku being a lot worse
I didn't remember being any decent with iku either, I need to make a deck for her
my favorite part is doing the dainty backflip after winning
I do remember that she was top tier next to sakuya I think
yeah probs
skullgirls has probably actually ruined what made me good before
now I actually block
well yeah, blocking is way worse here
but I think my fundamentals got a lot better
instead of just flying around like a maniac
if two touhous were in heaven and one killed the other with a rock would that be fucked up or what
butt smash
didn't that already happen
with the moon sisters
I think Iku is A tier, Sakuya is S tier, and Remilia and Yuyuko are A+ tier
I Forgot About Lasers
time to be a tier whore
suwako was bottom right? who was 2nd worst?
Cirno?
utsuho maybe?
all the expansion chars are bad
oh they updated it a few months ago
Yuyuko is now top

Utsuho is B+ tier somehow
what
I think Sakuya's S-tier is the only thing that keeps me from completely sucking
sakuya has the tightest blockstrings I think
I should probably practice with Reisen
I'm going to actually try with alice now
>implying you were't before
Utsuho reminds me of that post with the two dogs standing up. Her technique needs to be flawless to avoid being annihilated
because she gets wrecked easily since everything is so slow and open
something's bothering me
?
maybe it's just because I'm used to skullgirls but I feel like I'm getting trapped in the corner a lot more often
like I remember being able to blockstring pretty good
but I don't remember how
it's harder to get out of pressure, except there's border escape
which makes it completely stupid :V
no I mean
for some reason it's really hard to corner
well that was a waste
oh
yeah it's just harder in general
maybe it's just because I don't remember my bnbs
you're using sakuya! use 5C
and bouncy knives
I remember not being able to do the thing before
5C pushes like crazy doesn't it
also yeah I'm used to being able to attack behind me with bouncy knives
well I'm starting to get the hang of things at least
I forgot all about reisen's j6a
reisen has good aerials in general doesn't she
need to get in the mindset of using physical misdirection instead of bullets
YOM
ugh
I miss being able to do pushbacks
I still don't understand youmu's playstyle at all
I don't understand anything
she's fast and has no bullets and awkward melee???
ugh
holy fuck I love remi
Reisen really needs more disappearing crap
go play SWR when she was crap then
I still think her dash c sucks for not putting her in the air afterward
oh come on
brb
petition for reverge labs to produce next touhou fighter
y do you bounce around with characters so much
ugh
I was doing so good round 1
I switch bc the adhd is real
I even got you with the shield breaker

fine
so I can actually use the analytical skills I have
how you mess that up
I can't believe you fell for that
how patchy block
not that you really fell for anything
I can't believe I Hit You with the Big Laser

I went to find it
almost forgot about full sauce
Ok so
Anyone else actually following this Berenstein bears thing
people just need to accept that they remembered it wrong
^^
I remembered it Stein too
no uh dude
there are pictures of both
yeah
photoshop mang
or if they're not somehow shopped
then its simply the result of an inconsistent publisher
changing the name for a possibly antisemetic reason?

Maybe
I dunno, I specifically remember learning to spell them because it was a hard word
wait I thought it was called the Manala Effect
I always remember it being pronounced -stain anyways
Kappa
and spelling it Berenstein
I never learned to spell it
but I remember it being Stein too
w/e
because you just assume that names end with stein
it was so long ago, its probably false memories
and I've seen so many more stein words than stain words
since
that I assume it is one too
honestly though
as much as a hypothetical Mandele Effect sounds interesting
like, really interesting
if it turns out that the book really DID used to be Stein
I'd just chalk it up to publisher
using the wrong spelling and then sticking with it
rather than world hopping
seems more likely than 50% of the world's population being unwitting sliders
from a reality with a single, negligible difference
honestly a single difference seems more likely than a major difference
Depending on how the theoretical multiverse would arrange itself
yes
multiverse proximity makes a lot of sense
Putting similar universes near to eachother
but multiverse traversal seems like it would require a trigger
if the only differences between out dimensions is the name of the Bearenst*in bears
then THAT's the trigger
and that makes no fucking sense
the trigger wouldn't be the books themselves
if that's the DIFFERENCE then it has to exists BEFORE the trigger, right?
Books > trigger/shift > more books, but with half of a population shifted
yes but if the trigger isn't caused by the difference
then the traversal would occur in both dimensions
plus the fact that that's thinking merely from an eartly perspective
y'know the theory that time travel can never exist
because there are no time travelers here right now
or that aliens don't exist presently
because on the scale of the universe time-wise
they either are gone, haven't existed yet
or if they did exist they would have found us?
Its possible that aliens exist but they're at the same technological elvel at us
or slightly more or less
basically
not enough to ignore the traversal of millions of miles
if traversal across a multiverse were possible
it would only be possible within proximity of some trigger which enabled it
all universes local to that would share the capability
while those further would not, and never could
mandela effect is basically saying, even if they don't realize it
that we live on the border of that
and that, willingly or not, many people did cross over realities from a universe identical except for the A/E in a children's book series
the fact that we do not have the ability to go back
says that this universe, which is identical except for the bears
does not have the capability to cross dimensions
thus
having an E in the title of the book Bearenstain Bears enables multiuniversal traversal
which is ridiculous.
although, on reflection
if its true
but that thinks on a scale that
earth is by itself
the people who originally existed in this universe prior to the hypothetical switch
its possible that on other places there are more differences, but its only affect on earth is that difference
could have been displaced into that universe
which means the trigger would exist in both universes independently
but its something shared
On another note, with that time traveler thing
I fully submit to the theory that traveling back in time plops you into a universe where you did that. That traveling essentialy puts youinto a universe based on the fact you went back
yup
Rather than keeping you in your universe
because then you would have shown up
however
just pause and consider how depressing it is
that in a multiverse of infinite probabilities
we ended up in one where, to date, and likely forever
not one time traveler showed up
that we know of
where its existence is dependent on NOT JUST never receiving a time traveller
but its continuity depends on us never finding out time travel works
Whose to say that a time traveler could show up and just not reveal himself
maybe based on the pure fact that revealing as such
changes things
ok, so I get where you're coming from
but on the other hand
when did you last travel somewhere
anywhere
and not get pinned instantly as a tourist
Stein's Gate Time Travel model is pretty real, and reasonable
for short range time travel
haven't seen Steins gate
its basically what you're suggesting
time travel isn't real time travel
but dimension hopping to an iteration of your past self
in a universe who's continuity is dependent on your arrival from another reality
so that your actions do not cause paradoxes
but enforce continuity
I guess
but do you mean hopping into a past body
or that your body was there because you traveled and is essentially
the same body
as when you traveled
well you never move far enough to another reality that things are significantly different
you end up in a body that's performed all the same actions you did leading up to your arrival
but your arrival then changes events relative to the old timeline
So not like Quantum Leaping yourself into a past self but Quantum Leaping into a placeholder?
or
kinda
its Quantum Leaping into yourself
the situation is one constructed by your
your choices, personality etc.
its what you would have done leading up to that point
without the knowledge of the future that you already have
at that point, you begin to made obviously irrational decisions
because you have information that you couldn't ordinarily have access to
those decisions, which deviate from the dimension unaffected by time travel
basically define what makes this new dimension/timeline different
But that implies you could only jump along your own life-time
yes
Stein's Gate time travel model is exactly that
initially, at least
some time in the future a proper time machine is made
spoilers
but the crude one they invent in the series only allows sending of memories and thoughts
Hmmm
Interesting
Im gonna have to check that series out
In other news, I only JUST discovered the Protomen's Cover album
WARNING
Cassidy's account seems to be hacked,.


<<< FractalWizard,

Spam site.
are we talking about multiverse theory
mandala is neat, but quantum immortality is cooler B)
you mean mendele affect?

the mandela effect is just a really sophisticated way of winning any argument
"oh well I must just have switched over from a universe where I'm right"

a whole bunch of SU episode titles got revealed
there... there's a 3 parter
I need idea for space games
I'm going to indie galactic space jam
I have an oculus rift I can use too
publishing error
that no one really cared about
touhou in space
which comes out tomorrow!
or today
idk the timezones
spacegetti
I want to take the space theme vaguely seriously
considering there's like
nasa people there
they love the stupid stuff though
yeah it can be silly, but I don't want to go full memeage
I was thinking something that uses an actual list of planets/stars to randomly generate simple shmup

finally we can ask what happened to m*ma
I came from an alternate universe where she never disappeared but her name was mime
i tried sour cream for the first time
it's yummy
i'm gonna put it on everything
sour cream is pretty tasty
don't buy too much at a time tho
it goes foul fast if you don't use it shortly after opening
oh no :(
we bought some tortillas for it too
but they're not very yummy
eh, tortillas are tortillas
in my experience they're like vessels to get food into you
they CAN be really good
but even if they're bad, as long as the contents are good its ok
corn tortillas are actually delicious
flour tortillas by comparison are really bland
though cheaper
corn and flour tortillas are imo
wait what
you joking?
corn tortillas are the more expensive usually
yyyeah


<<< flour tortillas by comparison are really bland
though cheaper
anyways fallout shelter is out for android
huh I just searched and I guess you're right
idk why I thought flour tortillas were more expensive
odd
it might be different in other countries
but if America can do anything better than growing corn, it's growing other grains
lel
what's the corn state
wait
what's the flour state
the country has an entire region called the bread basket

anyways Illinois is the corn state
Iowa is the tall corn state
Kentucky is the corn-cracker state
Nebraska is the corn-husker state
so yeah lots of corn
how does a water treatment plant catch fire >:?
the chemicals used to treat the water?
by the time i get up new touhou hopefully
but also spoilers on me dash >_>
i think i stayed up once for a TH game
i think it was TD?
I stayed up for a few. Probably will stay up tonight
Might stream it if it's not too laggy
3am for me is 11am in japan
i assume it won't be out by then? :V
i could stay up until 5........
just wake up early?
we watched a talk about neural scanning and how it can be used in everyday life
and I turned to my friend and we both said "automatic memes"
honk
HONK
"memes of your life before you can even think of them"
so
how 'bout those 4 new characters
wait is the toohoo out rn?
yeah
we have all 4 new characters revealed
no spoilers or death
sephiroth expy, gamzee makara, Junko Enoshima, and Welcome To Hell
thankfully those are only vague spoilers
are we still in the "watching streams while waiting for the dl link" phase
yeah
a stream went live but i dont have it
idc to watch it
I'll probably stream my own blind run
what's the best shot type in lolk anyways?
welp I got spoiled already rip
I blame my adhd for making me compulsively click my tumblr bookmark
in the meantime can we talk gunnerkrigg
"On a completely unrelated note, Pori☆Pori Club (a web show ZUN is a "regular guest" in) had a public event in June 14, where each panelist presented one or two games they wanted to recommend. ZUN's recommendation was STARWHAL."
interesting that ZUN keeps up on western indies I guess?
that is interesting

from edelweiss?
oh its the whole thing
not just 15
are people shitting on touhou 15 gameplay and music yet
"zun's lost his touch" and whatnot
yes
:)
except it's characters
not music or gameplay
specifically america and punk rock maki nishikino

i'm losing my shit
okay but
what if kagerou went to the moon
re: gunnerkrigg I'm mad that Anthony's actions might have been in any way justifiable
or that they'll be presented that way
honestly I don't much like the idea of him being a 1 dimensional villain but I see your point
he doesn't need a redemption, he fucked up bad
idk
one-dimensional villains are boring but
(maybe bc of homestuck) I'm tired of villains that are basically completely irredeemable and then we find out they had the tiniest reason to be awful and it somehow excuses everything
well honestly that's largely a homestuck thing
because alt selves and hussie handing out redemptions like candy
doesn't mean I'm not tired of it
like okay maybe Anthony had reasons for what he did
doesn't make them not selfish reasons
but he still abandoned his daughter for two years (and apparently all his friends years before that?) and that's still awful
doesn't erase that he completely regarded etheric shit
doesn't erase being completely absent
and I don't want everyone else to go "oh you pour soul I guess you're alright"
like after this whole convo I just want Mr. Donlan to just say something witty and biting and just leave
anyways wanna play soku
I guess
gotta kill time before lolk
"you guess"
okay well we don't have to
maybe I'll just go back to micromanaging the shit out of my vault
evolve video ads are killing my motivation
but I want to play
you're not allowed to say any of this after what you put me through the other day
also gotta make decks
it's hard enough to fight you when you DON'T have a customized one
is there a way to copy decks to make slight tweaks
or change your decks in a lobby
in the profile folder
make a copy of the profile
edit that profile
eugh
yeh
no way to extract the contents of the profiles as far as I know
why couldn't they have just kept adding onto this game
and make copies of a deck in the same profile
I still like it way more than any of the newer ones
oh well I'll just edit it on a fly like I normally do
hosting whenever you're ready
one sec
or not
whoops
I'll wait

this deck will be fun
i think we have a lolk download up
????
we're verifying the lolk download to see if its legit
oh yeah bombs suck nvm
ye
you forgot that I have instant fullscreen laser
:3
"reversal"
?
RUDE
that's what I mean by reversal
you're always saying I should use reversals
so I found one that I can sort of use
patchy's just stinks
Elementoid saves replay
hmmm
ugh
I always forget to follow up my dash a
thx cloudy
you never stick with a character long enough
I need to remember my iku combo
okay yeah that's the iku I remember
but anyways you're always pulling out cards that I have no idea what they do
and then once I start to learn them you switch
the thing is, soku has that thing where you can tech unless the combo limits
and I can't do that so I can't knockdown
meanwhile you probably know my cards better than I do at this point
nah I don't pay attention to what you're doing
ooh 100% that last round
gotta remember how to border escape lol
thx typhoon
lol
okay I'm sticking with iku til I win with her
lol
you used up your deck there
did I
I wasn't paying attention
when I saw you gearing up to use a level 5 I was actually afraid for a moment
do iku's cards all suck
iku has no fast moves
at all
so yeah
lazers
one sec need to check on my vault
my explorers are doing a good job :)
yawn
"you never stay with one character long enough"
and look what happens when you do :)
I'd forgotten Reisen's a chained 4 times
no wonder doing her combos has been harder
what
I am free from this torture
nice
2/13 isn't so bad
good job
I refuse to believe that iku's framedata is so bad that your dash attack is completely safe on block
lol shrug
I can say the exact same thing in skuggle tho
that's just how Reisen is
have fun with actually fast melee
that WAS fun
ugh river mist
why do you care about river mist
you have bullets
I don't like having limited movement
ugh
I misplaced my lazer card
is the lolk link legit?
youch
brb vault again
also gunnerkrigg
ewwww
agreed
so is the consensus that
annie went into her coma because her father was trying to contact surma
?
yeah probably
he was trying to contact surma but just ended up contacting the fire elemental inside annie
also gross dog dude looks suspiciously like coyote
lol
and getting punched by zimmy too
this is when zimmy pops out from under the desk and wallops his other eye
I'm only good in soku with spammable dp
why doesn't Reisen get an invisible tech
she has her level 2 card...
and her dumb dragonpunch
I mean like how Yukari portals up
oh
you have your charged melee sorta
like fade out fade in
when she gets up
and your dash attack that fakes out
from being knocked down
yeah I'm not talking about how she can punch behind her
I mean when she gets knocked down
and then gets back up
reisen is already a runaway char
Yukari portals so you can't tell where she's goin
she doesn't need more escapes
why doesn't Reisen turn invisible
ugh
giant melee
my worst enemy
that is like
the least safe shit tho
just block it
you should be able to full combo off of it
I don'y think you'e in a position to question my methods ms. iku
you learned to block a thing at least
I messed up my bnb before lunatic eyes
otherwise it would have hit
I thought I had more than 1 bullet in the gap lmao
I ought to go to bed soon
the reverse spell mmmmm
one more then?
reisen wins
it's almost as if I'm more practiced than u
I forgot that you can high jump cancel skills until 2 matches ago lol
oh wait I forgot about that too
that's probably why my blockstrings are ass
the chain of cancels is a lot more complicated than in skullgirls

NEW TOUHOU
i like
all these designs
i need a download link
i'm gonna test that link
so far sogood
music room has all the musik
my controller keeps disconnecting
good shit
(that's not the games fault)
right the ere?
clownpiece is my new problematic fave
i like the sephiroth touhou better

i'm not wrong in thinking that the first three stages feel really nerfed, am i
they felt the same 2 me tbh
also stage 4 music is nice
it uses the thing
reed romance?
is reisen less terrible? because sanae still seems like best girl
i haven't tried reisen
i've been playing with sanae lol
sanae unfocused is really good for sagume
no offense
but the designs and music in this one  remind me of marine benefit
especially how froofy all the designs are
except I literally can't see her from the explosions during her second spell card
that's supposed to be  a marisa problem
final boss especially is like "let's go pick 10 random things out of a museum and arrange them about myself"
the exboss tho
what is the deal
with the
hot topic getup
america???
maybe we'll get sisters as the phantasm
haven't seen exboss yet
ck took forever to beat clownpiece
:o
the exboss is named after a gem
i see what you mean about sagume being easier unfocused
holy crap
except for the times when you can't see yourself
her second spellcard
omg
i think i got lucky ?
i stood in one spot unfocused and i didn't die
I died so many times when she had just a sliver on it
oh my god
the explosions killed the ying yangs
fuck the star ropes in stage 5
but it was nerve wracking
HER 3RD SPELLCARD
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
what do omg
it's just a barrage
sit at the bottom unfocused
This message has been removed.
sagume sis
what did i ever do to you
does this game save progress like the demo
because it's fuck it's late oclock
i think so
i accidentally quit and i could play with sanae on legacy
from the stage i was on
okay it does
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
stage 4 = reimu
stage 5 = marisa
stage 6 = ?
welp
i'm stuck on the laser fairies in stage 5 :V
people are so salty about the new designs
too salty
sagume is kind of like cassandra isn't she
in a way
Ant-Cassandra
Cassandra spoke truths and nobody believed her
Sagume speaks things and the opposite happens
"Blue skies" -> An eclipse happens and the sky turns red
I have several questions and thoughts about her

lolk music is good shit
tho i don't think i heard star spangled banner in clownpiece's theme >>
lolk download?
I scanned whole chat
o
and it looks like you all collectively just got a link
without posting it
is it time to tumble?
sec
i'll link


ty
in general lolk's danmaku is teetering on the line between trolly and trashy
have you seen stage 5 and Ex bosses
I think the whole game is that
lunarians.png
so in the touhou-verse western gods and goddesses dress like trashy teens
confirmed
I'm pretty sure this is going to be more criticized than the previous touhou games for gameplay anyways
makes seija look tame
i've heard people saying it's worse than ufo
idk how much that means but
UFO is considered good now though :>
10D is the trash one
shut up :c
I'm a mamizou fanboy I can talk shi tabout 10D whenever I want
;-;
i've heard people saying they'd rather deal with a more bullshit ufo lunatic than deal with most of lolk
or something like that
lolk is just... all bullshit
it doesn't stop being bullshit
yeah
I haven't gotten far in extra yet
the new lunatic meta is reisen's bombs
it looks slightly less bullshit
er i meant to say extra
not lunatic
whoops
but yeah
there's way too much instadeath memotrash in general
clownpiece's stripes should have a delay to them when they first appear, regardless if the main mode is pointdevice
is just crappy design
I will say, clownpiece's stuff is very puzzle-like
would be good in StB type game
junko is straight garbage
this is an StB type game
:V
also the guse foe cannon was funny
I'm just starting to play it now
or very soon
can't wait for stage 5
i hope you like
shotgun lasers
is the reason for clownpiece's design stated anywhere?
or is she just a hell fairy who is suspiciously american
she literally just found the moon landing flag and was like "mmmm imma wear this"
that's probably what it was?
didnt the americans in touhou canon plant the flag in a "dead" part of the moon
and you know who is doing stuff to that specific part (can't spoilet yet?)
i sagume's wing actually a wing ?
it kind of looks like a ponytail
i dont think anyone actuallt knows
i like wing better because i can make sepiroth jokes
OH
ck the new music
you like?
what the fuck
is this stage 5 curtain fire bullshit
clownpiss and junk
on one hand, it's better to have a rage-inducing boss than a completely forgettable one
but
I can't get past the blue and red curtains
or, I got past the blue ones
but the red ones
fuck me
wait which one
the up and down stripes?
the fairies that sweep across the screen
I just got past it
and I'm on America now
time to kill the president
funny valentine x clownpiece
data
i'm busy being angry about videogames
but i'll see what i can do :0
i think i have a joke in mind already
touhou 15 ~ dada-nmaku
"You need to take these classes for your course."
"Lol they aren't being offered even though theyre fall only"
FUCK you college
"doremy" = dreamy
"clownpiece" = clownpiss?
i can't get past stage 5
no bombs and i'm stuck on a part i've seen 3 different clear bomb at
^^^
the curtains of blue?
and red stars?
that part held me up for like 40 minutes
no bombs


<<< tho i don't think i heard star spangled banner in clownpiece's theme >>

no atha
the fairies that shoot the laser balls and stars
the fact that "lunatic" is actually IN the name is gonna make looking through lunatic playthroughs somewhat difficult
does point legacy mode give you endings >_>
reisen still sucks
i think she may have been buffed a little (or the demo bosses were nerfed) but she's still pretty bad
:<
her bomb tho (thumbs up)


yeh Reisen's only saving grace is her bomb
esp. in point device mode
3 extra hits to get between chapters
which carry into new chapters
godlike
but if you run out of bombs
like
just quit
lowest movespeed
lowest damage
tbh she has a space rabbit gun
why isn't she more powerful (it even has bunny ears come on)
piercing shot doesn't do shit vs bosses
you get fucked in every possible way
yeah srsly
I wished she'd be OP like Youmu in TD
I mean, its not like having OP characters is a bad thing
its not competetive
every char is its own challenge
it would have been nice to see the new playable char be OP from the start
clownpiece codpiece clownpiece codpiece clownpiece codpiece clownpiece codpiece clownpiece codpiece clownpiece codpiece clownpiece codpiece
hey ck if you stream more lolk I'd watch
man you just missed me
streamed for 4 hours at www.twitch.tv/athanasianGainsay
athanasiaGalaxy whistles nonchalantly
I beat America!
on normal
got to last spell of last boss
no bombs
and uh
after 50 tries
just put it to rest for tonight
I want to see a no bomb run of lunatic
all the lunatic 1ccs are for the demo
junk's theme is my favorite now
hecatia's sounds kinda generic :S
actually junko seems like a cool character
uh besides being out for revenge
oh so basically clownpiece is only dressed like america because it pisses off lunarians (besides being a fairy and being a subordinate of junko/hecatia)
i can believe t but is there a source?
nope
lepw
*welp
can't wait for the english patch
i wanna know how everything ends
'cause the story is a bit more serious this time
yeha I can believe her dressing like that
for that reason
rather than being the "American Flag abandoned on the Moon" Youkai
but it still means she's AMERICA for the sake of AMERICA
and not just a cooincidence
since the lunarians hate the AMERICAN invaders and their impure garbage
:V
also:
"can you imagine sagume denying being gay as like a kneejerk reaction and then waking up the next morning and realizing that she just had a wet dream about toyohime"
in regards to this, Derx
that's basically what every god/goddess is like with Toyohime
Sagume is no exception
gay or otherwise
toyohime is great
not as great as yorihime, but
phantasm patch
for real?
in 15?
I called it!
extra stage boss with the ability to have 3 bodies
unusually easy extra stage
we're getting 3 versions of the extra stage
one for each body
hey the extra in pcb wasn't easy :V
no
(for me anyways ;.; )
but apparently (and I haven't gotten to it yet) this one is
like, stage 5 level difficulty
only hard part is the length
Hah
Talk about timing
which, presumably, is trivialized by point device


<<< "can you imagine sagume denying being gay as like a kneejerk reaction and then waking up the next morning and realizing that she just had a wet dream about toyohime"
in regards to this, Derx
that's basically what every god/goddess is like with Toyohime
Sagume is no exception

The person who made the post initially
Just posted this

:V
wrong hime
destroy akiraita
wait no
fuck me I got the wrong him
e
peaches vs swords
ok who's the moon bitch and who's the one with the sword
its been too long since I touhoumon'd and needed to know this
but seriously, if Extra was easy this time around
and Phantasm is normal extra stage difficulty
what's version 3?
sword is yori
peach is toyo
ok right then
somehow I did get it backwards
I used to know this shit
Yorihime is the one that makes gods swoon

Toyo just sits in a palace drinking and fanning herself
isn't her fan a weapon
yes
yes
iirc it destroys things utterly
ala flan
she blows herself away
literally
by affecting their boundaries?
anyways toyohime is good but yori is better
I think it might have been stolen or something from Yukari
nah Toyohime is bland imo
Yorihime was more expressive
and impressive
she's the Moon's Reimu
Toyohime is the Moon's Yukari
in more ways than one
but she has even less appearances
but yukari isn't bland :<
so she doesn't even get to show off who she really is
she's just a mysterious fan waving asshole
who's super strong but does nothing
Yukari gets to show off a little at least
nah her fan is lunarian advanced lunarian magiscience weaponry
oh ok
which doesn't make snse
if they're so powerful
I know that Toyohime affects the moon's existence
as like, her ability
she can change how people perceive the real/fake moon
why not just wave her fan and blow up wherever junko and the hell fairies are
she can affect its distance and perception relative to earth
use physical features to literally merge the two
so the fan being as powerful and having the abilities it does
always seemed out of place
didn't really fit the rest of her ability set
I always assumed it was taken from someone else
specifically Yukari's
since the fan seems to be suspiciously similar to Yukari's system card in Soku

he has the art for one of them done too (tho this was long ago)

thank you chrome
that was a close one
omfg
i wonder if we'll get a tie-in manga  for lolk

aww
never forget
the gensokyan seal

in the future we stop believing in seals

zun's not the only one to forget about SSiB
since in the next chapter reimu forgets she can summon and talk to gods
"madame gensokyo" oh my god
never forget 
so was the phantasm patch thing
real or a joke?
cuz I can't find it
it'd be kinda dumb to release a patch what
two days later?
athanasiaGalaxy looks at tasofro awkwardly
I mean an "add content" patch not a "fix broken shit" patch
joke
ok
zun said we can't fight the sisters
they're too stronk even with the spellcard rules

the ULiL arrangements are out on YT
hmm
junko doesn't have a title
nope
i read the explanation of it on the wiki
what a weird vengeful lady
_A mysterious god who governs the Hells of the moon, the Earth, and Otherworlds.
She has a separate body in each of the three worlds, and can act independently with each of them._
oh
so she's the hell goddess?
hell being jigoku?
maybe
I think the text used to talk about the dream world
is the same that was used in PC 98
so maybe both hell and dream world in LoLK are the same worlds as back then?
this game might really be ZUN's biggest troll
Phantasm Patch
Phantasm boss: Moma
new character
if you invert junko's colors they become mima's colors :V
a NEW evil spirit inhabiting the hakurei shrine
after Mima was killed in SWR
she probably was tho
;-;7
ok I linked the "anyone can learn to draw" post to a friend
with EoSD Sakuya and Junko side by side
now they want a picture of EoSD style Clownpiece
what do?
just make her look more anorexic
and remove some of the more coherent details
IOU - clownpiece EOSD style - 20102
have the game theorists done touhou
don't think so
I ask tongue-in-cheeck because I think they're stupid
and it would be funny to watch them horribly misinterpret foreign media
gaijin goomba analyzing imperishable night


so uh
my team won indie galactic space jam with our game
the prize was $5000 split between us, and the sponsor talked to us about promoting the game
it's also recognition from Microsoft and NASA so that's pretty cool

a song I did for the thing (cheesiest space song ever)

as someone who's been trying to find a job for over two months without success, congrats on the fractional prize money
omfg
nice
to say the very least
what did you make?

this one. it's local multiplayer with gamepad only, so you might not be able to play unfortunately
but I'll do video soon
so anyone know the story of lolk yet
hecatia and junko were mad at some moon lady imprisoned in the lunar capital so they set clownpiece to fuck with it so they could get at the lady and in response the lunarians were like "we don't wanna deal w this shit let's just go invade Earth" ??
also Doremy was there
?
the stage 6 theme might be my favorite
I might just also be a sucker for this chord progression
it never fails
the first time I hear new touhou music I dislike it
and then hours later I realize it's stuck in my head
omg ck grats :0
yeh stage 6 theme is pretty hella
markiplier is playing hunie pop

it took way too many tries to realize clownpiece's first card is a timeout
^^^
I was not expecting it to be timeout
when I played it first time
I spent like 20 minutes before going
cuz it was pretty clear that illusionary dominance and sinker ghost were timeouts
"WAIT SHE HAS NO HP BAR"
yeh
illusionary dominance and sinker ghost completely remove the boss from the stage
come to think of it, most timeouts do
she has two timeouts
or otherwise alert you
well yeah Data
but after the first time out
I was ready
clownpiece is clownpain
clownpiece?
more like
clownPIECEOFSHIT
I have no idea to do on the second rotation at all
I actually forget which timeout is second rotation?
that's the 1 moon one right?
with the sun?
yeah
i mean her first card
you have to stay on the dark side of the moon
the first go around is simple enough
oh, uh
just stay on the opposite side of her
from the 3 moons
don't even try to avoid the moons
they move too fast
still with just one moon
just avoid the bullets as you circle her
since its timeout you're not rewarded for staying in front of her anyway
use the whole screen to dodge
stay as far ahead of the moons as you can
to the point you're actually right behind them
(but don't do that actually, if you're too close the bullet spawns will hit you)
I beat it consistently on normal now
using that strat
if you're doing hard+ tho
I have no idea
i'm on normal
Jaimer's vid shows that the faster spinning moons cancel less bullets
and it gets stupidly dense fast
oh i didn't check the wiki today
i need to read reisen's story :x
00.78 seconds remaining!
nice
now i dodn't remember what i did
rip me
it's a shame zun switched to 99+ for the history
^^
I can't see the accurate number of hours I wasted
its funny cuz the highest I ever saw in other touhou games is like
my total attempts for Nine Syllable Stabs is close to 400
20-30 attempts
cuz I don't do practice much
but then in this game
in 2 plays
I have 99+ on most of stage 5 and 6
CAPTURE!!!!!
now for the rest of the fight
she didn't drop power items....
i figured out my touhou-selfs power
the ability to put anything to sleep
eternal duelist soul has a nice 8-bit soundtrack damn
well it's prob 16-bit it's just one of the few GBA games that doesn't use instrument samples besides percussion
You are unable to bear witness to my present successes on this day, which I have laid claim to

you can see skullgirls on my computer lmao
last time I'm gonna throw this out there
but One Way Heroics is back on sale on steam
87 cents
AND the PLUS expansion thing is out on steam now too
also slightly discounted for ~$6
if you have seen any of it at all, I really recommend it
?

the expansion is apparently done and the translation as finished as its going to get
both are on sale
game for .87
expansion for 5.84
expansion is just a full overhaul of the game
makes it a lot more playable, new endings and stuff
items, areas, etc.
no enabling it or anything
on playism, it was a full standalone version of the game
hmmmmm
pokemon moba (bc 4 moves)
that
could actually be interesting
I mean mobas as a game type are interesting games its just community
Dependingon how you implemented things, it could serve as a pretty fun game
clownpiece clear! her 3 moon card was a lot easier than her 1 moon
what if clownpiece had a spell
where she summoned 3 kagerous
and they all do that three point triangle pattern she has
at different intervals
so it's just common AWOOOO
3 wolf moon
so which of the new characters do you suppose were just shoehorned in for zun's new side-project
when you follow someone bc inspo and they follow back and like your stuff...\
I just realized what doremy's ex danmaku reminds me of
it's my own spell -.- 
the first one
the effects of the "Game over in 3 steps" one looked cool
wait isn't that inferno "Burst Nova" one a lot like your jade one
well they both had suns I guess
tbh the only spells there that had a coherent design were kisume's and yuugi's
I think ph3 had just come out so I was in a rush

lmao
[muffled beloved tomboyish daughter in the distance]
so trying to timeout junko's final card is different than usual
it actually progresses through the phases rather than goes into kill mode at a certain time
also her curvy laser card seemed more like rng than me actually being good at the game
next splatfest is autobots vs. decepticons
I really wish we got to keep the splatfest tees
wait what's ZUN's new project?


<<<  zun's new side-project
????????????
????????
etoid what r u talking about



I just want this demonic game to end
666 graze
you can (not) continue

okay i'm not hitting her at all
what
OH CHRIST NO
DO NOT FUCKING TELL ME
that she is still in her death state
did game go fuckky?
can you not hurt her anymore?
I can't hurt her and my movements are slower
aaaaaaaaahaha
gj ZUN
made a game so hard, it gave up playing itself
oh ya
that's a known glitch
someone: I really like touhou 15's bullet patterns, they're extremely fun and engaging, providing a complex challenge of reading and reacting to shifting patterns
she's invicible
me: lol k
and resorts to a slow pattern
Unreasonable Mechanism: The Unfunny Edition
basically
I'm still sorting out how I feel about th15
I love most of the characters, and I love how he handled the game's demo presentation vs full launch
but so much of it is
I'm still laughing about how the game was perceived pre launch compared to now
if you are not in the exact right spot
you will die
but yeah, so many of the patterns are just unfun
even if they're cool and challenging when you KNOW what to do
looking at this game from the sort of arcade perspective that it's meant to emulate
err, that all shooters really emulate
so many patterns STEAL lives from you by not giving you a chance to even read what's happening
and some are just downright unfair
ala ISC
which is still PLAYBLE because of point device
but not FUN
because you just want to get on with them
next game tone down the difficulty to the usual and make pointdevice Stage Practice exclusive
you can't put one down and play another while you think over the puzzle
last boss is just dumb
thematically her spell cards and nonspells mostly make a lot of sense
but really, ZUN?
her danmaku feels like early game stuff just scaled up a lot harder
was that first nonspell really necessary?
not all, but MOST of Junko's danmaku
is just bullet hell purified down to its core elements
dense patterns
often fast bullets
and then amplified to the extremes
with a shitload of health
but
that isn't fun
fucking, first nonspell ISN'T FUN
I spent 40 minutes on it alone
just making small errors
where I'd dodge the patterns 6 times
the left right dodging spellcard I eventually just gave up on
but then the 7th, I'd fuck up
and OH NO GOTTA START OVER
that one, I beat
trick was just to move into the gap before they speed up too much
or, to put yourself against he wall and move vertically to catch the hole
but it still wasn't very fun
final card is just awful tedium
^^^
that really seems to be the mantra of this game
at least bombs do damage
first few stages were clever and fun
the difficulty was refreshing
and cards were sorta puzzle-like
esp. Doremy
stage 4 was also pretty fun, but then Sagume's stuff felt almost untested
a lot of the time
esp the one with the circling familiars
I beat it ONCE with Sanae, and died before the chapter ended so I had to do it again
and that was a fluke
even Jaimers says its nearly impossible to beat with her above Easy
because her snakes target the familiars instead of Sagume
what kind of design is that?
Clownpiece's lasers are just awful too
appear too quickly, already moving
and with no audible/visual cues in advance
I think I just went unfocused with sanae on stage 4
because I believe I did capture all of her stuff
I tried to do that multiple times, but I couldn't a) do enough damage and/or b) navigate the mine field
also junko's bullets are slowed down too
everything else Sagume used, I captured
so I can just time them out
does the game do a replay on pointdevice
only up to first death iirc
either way it'll probably desync
also it just occurred to me
the current group name was in reference to Jake as a Fairy in that touhoustuck reverse thing
but its suddenly very relevant
I DID IT I TIMED HER OUT
1148 deaths
wow
what the fuck
And yeah, I captured all spell cards aside from two of Junkos (one being literally impossible)
??
which one?
oh right
:V
thought you meant another one
wow nice job
most deaths on a card was that other one I skipped, 199
unless it stopped counting



<<< it's my own spell -.- 


<<< etoid what r u talking aboutsometimes it seems like he sticks new characters into the games just so that he can use them in other stuff eg Aya, Mamizou, Seija
so the question is which new char will become inexplicably important in some new side-thing
which one do you think?
hm
I'd guess either Clownpiece or Hecatia
Great Fairy Wars II: America Attacks
junko for ssib2 pls
I like that Junko doesn't have a title
fitting
cuts the bullshit
no complicated names
just Junko
it means like "gold" or "treasure" or something
so does anyone know the story yet or was I basically correct before
I'm still going off partial translations I've seen posted everywhere
but basically Junko was mad at some moon lady
usurped the lunarian throne
Chang'e
hey, whoa WHOA
she's a Chinese moon lady
WHO'S TELLIN THE STORY
me
through you
don't try to put specifics in my hip and happenin retellin of the mad truth?
apparently Chang'e's husband stole the sun or something and made hell cold?
chang'e's husband shot down the sun(s) killing junko's child (and husband, translations jump around this) and blocking out light which makes shadow disappear or something (thus hecatia just kinda hanging out with junk)
junko dies (?) becomes a divine spirit and purifies herself into a being of pure vengeance/rage (kinda anyway)
wait how does Hecatia fit in there
if light doesn't exist, shadows don't either
and that affects hell somehow (it being a land of death and shadows i guess?) thus hecatia being pissed off
apparently one of the suns that were shotdown was apollo
who IS Hecatia
the goddess of hell
isn't she western
based off of Hecate
yes
okay so Junky and Hecky are mad at Chang'e
junko enlists hecatia to command the (purified with life force) hell fairies to invade the moon to scare off lunarians (hecatia has the power to exist in 3 places at once; earth, moon and spirit/dream world)
those 3 places seem kinda random
guess that explains why Doremy's there tho
since chang'e is imprisoned  away in the capital for drinking the hourai elixir, driving away lunarians to a more vunerable place (the dream world) they can get a chance to strike her down
which sort of plays into junko's simple danmaku, they're simple but they're pretty much focused on the act of killing, she's a very straightforward lady
alright
and then the lunarians go from being in the dream world to invading gensokyo?
Sagume is a powerful, but subtle lunarian goddess
apparently orchestrated the gensokyo invasion, which is actually an evacuation of the moon
oh right her
everyone jumped to the dream world passage to earth to escape Junko and the fairies
and they're just waiting for Gensokyo and all of the Earth to be purified
but Sagume deliberately did a shitty job of that
...?
cuz she doesn't actually want to purify the Earth
but since sagume spoke to you, you being an unforeseen circumstance
she wanted to get someone's attention
which she did
when you fight her, she ultimately is doing the whole Orin thing, of testing your abiltiies
and after beating her
she doomed the evacuation plan and sent you off to destroy whoever's doing the stuff
tells you her plan
and Junko's plan
very carefully worded
to say that Junko and herself WOULD DO THOSE THINGS
essentially ensuring their failure
Junko would get her ass kicked
and The lunarians wouldn't invade earth, and would go home
wait it's Sagume that tells the truth/lies
yes
oh
Sagume's ability is to accidently say things that are wrong
but being extraordinarily powerful
and universally loathed
as in, loathed by reality itself
everything she says BECOMES false
by causality
by saying things, she makes them wrong
but doesn't control the methods that it occurs
wait you mean like
hence why she didn't just use her power sooner
to stop Junko
the things she says become a universal falsehood
she couldn't control what would happen
if she said "junko will successfully usurp the Lunar capital and conquer the moon forever"
if she says the sky is blue, nature itself will do something to make it red (like an eclipse)
or fate conspires to change circumstances such that whenever she says something, stuff becomes wrong
^^^^
fate causes events which makes anything she says
eventually turn out to be wrong
but like I was saying
she can't control what happens
if she tried to stop Junko sooner
she might inspire a rebellion among the lunarians
and have them throw themselves into combat against her like martys
great
she stopped junko
and devastated the lunarians
everyone is dead
so she needed to get someone's attention, who was capable of defeating Junko
and then just giving them the small push to make SURE it happened
so she waited for an opportunity where the fate of least resistance would involve the heroine
if it was a 20% chance that they'd beat junko
she could make it 100%
yes exactly
neat
she's cooler than I thought then
basically, she is one of the lesser and more subtle lunar gods
clownpiece is still my fave tho
who doesn't interact with others much
because her power is too unpredictable
Yorihime can't get any use out of it
other gods can't
she really can't, unless very specific circumstances are met
so she just rarely speaks or does anything
and chooses her words very carefully to nudge things in the right direction
why's the universe hate her so much
she's a goddess of fate or fortune
but in reverse
why does everyone hate Seija?
why does Seija hate everything?
a goddess of misfortune?
not really, that's what makes it weird
isn't that what hina is
she tries to bring good fortune
but she just goes about it in a weird way
is why I say reverse
a goddess of contrivedly roundabout good fortune
pretty much
apparently she's somehow related to amanojaku
mythologically
not necessarily in touhou canon
but she might have been the original amanojaku, or the progenitor of them or something?
huh

has it really been so long
remember that time Eirin almost stabbed patchouli in the back

oh
Data puts away party decorations
is it normal for your IP address to change?
I think so
which one
internal/external?
uuuuuhhhh
idk?
basically if you disconnect X, your respective IP will often change
disconnect?
if its the public external IP then that means your router probably went down
oh there was something weird early with the internet
i guess that must have been it
but I think your ISP (at least in the US) will usually have a constant IP in that case
if you disconnect your computer from the internet
you almost always get a new internal IP
when the router reconnects to you
it defaults to dynamic, but you can make it static if you need to
what is this touhou skydrift thing
and is it multiplayer
touhou kart double dash with online
well uh
sounds cool
WAIT YOU RIDE THE PARTHNER?>
how many charas
i don't know how many, a decent amount at least
a lot it seems
are kasen or kokoro there

Kokoro for sure
GOOD GAME
items are different though
theres the download
instead of boxes you hit speed gates that build meter
and when you get a full bar you can get your random item
i'm only a couple chapters into the campaign because my laptop can't handle it that well
well
ima try it
uhhh
I may have fucked up the controls
can you use gamepad
yes


<<< do you have to do versus a certain amount before you can do campaign
yes skydrift is hilarious
how do unlock campaign
help
null
how do unlock campaign
I can only play local
you just
have to
do it
no like
only option I can choose
is local
versus local and config
that's it
I don't know
Maybe you have to make a profile?
Did you do the patch thing
I just don't know, I pressed buttons and stuff happened
You need to patch it
It seems this is a common issue for some reason
well like I cant read it
Yeah
Hold on
i just downloaded the 1.0000 version or w/e
Thats also a common issue.

Download the latest patch from her, apply it
Everything'll be fixed
Except for the inability to:
- play free roam
- open the gallary
- play netplay
the 1000 -> 1006 version?
if you want to do those, best be ready to shell out 30 dollars
it requires a serial key
oh
so you gotta pay to paly with others?
you gotta actually buy the legit game, yes
not pirate it
i didn't even realize it was legit honestly
I thought it was some fan game
it's a c88 game
?
comiket 88
comiket
it's a fangame released at comi this year
it's like a con thing where you buy indie games and fangames
and lots and lots of h-doujin
and the developers probably knew people would pirate the game so they made it so you could still play campaign and versus, but would need to buy the actual game for the rest of the stuff
It also nets you alternative costume colors apparently too
so basically this is the full version lite
interesting
yeah
i'm sure someone'll probably get a legit copy and figure out how to crack the stuff for others
because thats what pirates do
hey derx any other interesting games released?
Age of Ethanols III's demo came out
:0

i'm playing through easy as marisa
it's a massive joke in comparison and a lot less horseshit in that if you have bad starting placement you actually have the time and space to recover
though clownpiece's stars and stripes spellcard ended up killing me a few times just because i'm used to it being super fast
junko's only challenge is she just has uncomfortably high health
well that and tiny unfair gaps in fast bullets
its that you have to make lots of micro dodges
without fucking up
for a long time
any of those would be ok alone
all 3
why, ZUN?
which is something i'd expect from Extra Stage final spellcards
I really like maple dream but every time I look for arrangements of it the searches just turn up more eternal dream ~ mystic maple
does anyone know the name of that indie game where it's simply pulling tetris-block like stones out of a wall to climb it?

steven universe rpg idea #4: it's like earthbound but in the SUverse and peridot is there
not going to lie, SU in EB style is kinda giving me a game design boner
she's like "AHAHAHAHA (this is a nerdy laugh)  SEE YA CRYSTAL CLODS! (at this point she flies away on evil!helicopter dog)"
she spreads gem shards (the ones in the frybo episode idk if they were regular or special ones) making objects in town come alive and attack people
ya
SU's setting and lore seems so good for an EB type game

idk if this is old news to some but they're reworking the M2 side of M1+2 on the gba
for now it's just a port of the EB script to the M2 game and later the graphics and things will change as well to accomodate the script (like the pencil/octopus thing)
frac and ck do you two still play GW2?
I have it, haven't played in a long time
gnarly dude
gw2 is totally tubular
I might get back into it soon

i didnt post the news on it but, supposedly this battle style is a new one
and is apparently the "Hopeless Masquerade Battle"?
we dont have a full scan on it so

derx that sounds like
battle arena or w/e from emerald?
where you don't win strictly based on KOs
Maybe actually

gl
if junko was in touhoumon
she'd have 200 base special attack but the tiniest movepool
255 sp. attack
no physical moves
no special moves over 40 BP
only the equivalent of normal type attacks
not even status moves or protect
so illusion
i guess
only normal + STAB + basic effects
all moves have damage
sheer force
no pure status or stat buffing moves
lots of moves have added effects
but never unique effects
only things like % chance paralysis
sheer force would be busted
no, sheer force
oh even better
aka she'd get thundershock
but never thunderbolt or higher
because they're too complex
also low speed and defenses so easy to revenge kill
she only gets PURE moves
she only has moves with "ring" in the name
that would be aqua ring and st-ring shot
hecatia would probably have substitute and regenerator just to emphasis the multiple bodies thing

Okay so that "HM battle" thing I was talking about
I think it was alluded to in an NPC's dialogue in the village
Where they say they miss Kokoro's "Shinkirou", which
Shinkirou is a play based on the events of Touhou Shinkirou ~ Hopeless Masquerade, performed by Hata no Kokoro and either written or co-written by Mamizou Futatsuiwa. It combines traditional Noh performance with modern comedic dialogue, and has become popular for Kokoro's exaggerated portrayals of the fighters in the "holy war".
So maybe Kokoro adapts her play to match the Puppet crisis
I'm thinking of streaming... rollercoaster tycoon
either 1 or 3 because those are the ones I own
and you know, obviously taking suggestions from stream and all that. it's too slow paced for it to be entertaining otherwise
3 is so ugly but has the best crashes tbh
1 has a retro charm to it
2 is just objectively better than 1 and has the sandbox mode but I forgot to buy it :(
3 would be better if we're going with sandbox mode
1 has more engaging scenarios
I'm going to do 3 if OBS works with it
I'll set up OBS to do both in case people want to switch
starting at 7:30 

omg aw
i'd get you 2 if i could :c
the good version
honestly the scenarios in 2 aren't as interesting as 1
if you were going to play 1, and wanted a sandbox theme park, you'd want to play 2 tho
3 is entirely separate but tbh my computer is great at running it so that eliminates most of the issues
most people hate it because it ran like shit when it first came out on top of being ugly
now it's just ugly :V
I put all my touhou and homestuck music into RCT's music folder
now I can make the trashiest theme park known to man

did I miss rctc streaming
I want to see ck mismanage his finances and drive his shitty touhou themepark into the ground
and then complete the objective on a technicality
I made a bunch of shitty unfunny troll coasters
and I also cleared a spooky park scenario with one coaster
even though it was supposed to be 3 separate stages
oh, the other good thing about rct2 was they fixed how much people feared coasters
iirc
like you were actually able to make intense ones and people wouldn't automatically hate them?
idk I was like 9 the last time I played
I made a coaster with 20 intensity and would just close and reopen it so that people would think it's safe again
also a slide called BYE that just spirals into hell
but yeah pls stream so that I may live vicariously through u
as I am super bored

like maybe it'd be a good thing to learn if you've got some free time?

unless you actually plan to pursue a career in just that
yeah
doing drivers or something
it's basically the lowest you can get language-wise aside from outright writing instructions in binary code

and then make the bot repeatedly hold each doremy in succession
yeh probably Etoid
actually just make every image search return the last image that that twitter tweeted
boom instant drostemy
etoid make a bot that replies to random tweets with ambivalent responses
be more specific
okay I guess
no I mean
whatever
define "random" more specifically
otherwise twitter will probably ban it for spamming
tru
like should it ambivalently reply to tweets asking sarcastic questions
how would you sort out sarcastic questions
unless they're tagged or something
shrug
you tell me
I guess
nah
give the bot a very generic name
something that would be said somewhat commonly
but only in specific situations,
like "exhilarating"
bad example but w/e
any time it hears that word
it appears
"you rang?"
followed by intentionally incomprehensible chatbot jibberish
so it should be named god
innuendo bot
oh god
innuendo bot
"you rang?"
innuendo bot
it tries so hard to make sexual puns
but just
chatbot
no one can tell what its trying to reference
it replies to all of its own posts with the lemmy emote
I could build an AI that learns how to talk by chatting with people on a pornsite or something
oh god
why haven't you?
I'm still working on the AI
innuendo bot: yeh, the AI is incomplete for sure. That's what SHE SAID!
(lemmyface)
if you come up with a list of phrases to which the bot could respond "that's what she said" I'll program it
but really, it seems to me that its nearly impossible to make a bot write anything coherent or actually relevant without it becoming completely repetetive
so I say, embrace idiocy
don't make it respond to actual innuendos
make it turn entirely innocuous things into innuendos
what part of AI did you not understand
which keep people guessing what its actually referring to
the I part
so I should make a list of english words ending in "er"
where the part preceding the "er" is itself a proper verb
to which the bot responds "X 'er? I 'ardly know 'er!"
oh god
don't even check if it's a verb
"ang 'er? I 'ardly know 'er!"
exactly
I like my idea better
h 'er I 'ardly know 'er
ha
ck code up a touhou boss that's exactly like a canon boss but all the bullets move in reverse
I actually wondered about that after watching Koishi Heck
I'd say seija but she's so gimmicky to begin with it wouldn't matter
how hard is it to make bullets fly towards a boss
it
on a nonlinear trajecctory
isn't really
oh
where they bounce around or spiral
yeah that'd be harder
it's easy, it's harder to make a good design involving that gimmick
fair enough
I didn't say it would be a good design
bullets inwards towards the boss is already done to death tbh
so the only thing the gimmick would add
is the bullets "predicting" where the boss will move to
so they can spawn from the right place
yeh
ie the boss would just move towards where they were converging
from the player's point of view, it's pmuch the same as spawning from randomly changing spots
[8/24/2015 12:14:42 PM] *** Elementoid sent LR_Rocket_Racer_Run_Lu9.mid ***
turn that into 2hu
if it's involving transforming bullets, it becomes more interesting I guess
idk if you can really call it done to death tho
there's really only 3 options
the bullets shoot away from the boss
the bullets shoot toward the boss
or the bullets shoot in some direction regardless of relation to the boss
tbh it's bosses shooting bullets away from themselves that's done to death
well you're assuming all bullets spawn directly from the boss in this case
bullets from familiars, edges of the screen, controlled by player actions in some way, etc
that would fall under the third option
if you were to do reverse bullets, a spiral/ring pattern is about all you can do
without the gimmick getting buried
unless it's like, an ex boss where every spell uses the same gimmick
then you can do some build up, but ehhhhh I don't think we're going to see it done better than koishi heck or ex keine
this is just a really simple and poorly developed idea
but what about a marisaesque one
spiraling familiars
shooting inward
but they move in advance
telegraphing the bosses movements
the boss sorta rushes around to "catch" the bullets as they converge
idk
oh I'm 20 mins late
gret
I need a random chunk of text for my AI to process
sorry
I deleted my macro to repost the entire log of @dril tweets
sorry
I never had such a macro
but now I want one
that'll work
okay ag I tried to make a robot clone of you using the last 15 of your messages or so but it's not enough
and I'm too lazy to write something to parse a bunch of them out for me
once I get the general algorithm working I'll try processing the bee movie script or something
fuck yes
autonasianGainsponder
or something
ugh don't remind me
"i am recently become a sinnamon roll"

rip
ugh
ugghhh
when are we getting more nichijou anime
do I need to dig up the rant about why it makes me mad
it's less of a rant than I remember 
anyway here's something else I found in my nichijou tag while I was looking for that 
season 2 might come during the winter season (?)
or as a celebration of the manga ending (???)
I would murder ten men to get the full-length version of this song 
Hecatia: Hey, is it okay if I come over to your place to play next time?
marisa does it again
Sanae: In that case... Do battle with me at once! You freaky T-shirt weirdo!
Stanchurian Candidate was super good
